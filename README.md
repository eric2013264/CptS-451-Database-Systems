# CptS-451 Intro to Database Systems

Spring 2017 taught by Sakire Arslan Ay

Our Milestones marked the our progress on the Yelp Dataset Challenge

Given a csv and JSON files of textual information we were told to parse them into SQL  insert statements so we could store and manipulate that data in a Postgres database.

Python used for parsing JSON
SQL used for insert, create table, and queries.
C#, Visual Studio was used for the GUI
