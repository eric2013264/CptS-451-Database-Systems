# CptS-451 Intro to Database Systems

Spring 2017 taught by Sakire Arslan Ay

Our Milestones marked the our progress on the Yelp Dataset Challenge

Given a csv and JSON files of textual information we were told to parse them into SQL  insert statements so we could store and manipulate that data in a Postgres database.

Python used for parsing JSON
SQL used for insert, create table, and queries.
C#, Visual Studio was used for the GUI

JSON files are not included. Please see “Yelp Dataset Challenge” for the CSV file and JSON files. They were too large to be included.

All programming assignments are password protected. Please don't plagiarize. If you want to reference an assignment of mine, please contact me at eric.chen@wsu.edu for the password.
